### 1. Direct Sales (Primary)

**Platforms:**
- Gumroad (8.5% + $0.30 fee)

- 20 sales/day × $9.99 = $599.40/day = **~$18,000/month**

### 2. Email List Building

**Strategy:**
1. Offer free short e-book (lead magnet)
2. Build email list of interested readers
3. Promote paid e-books to subscribers

**Example:**
- 1,000 subscribers × 3% conversion × $9.99 = **$300/launch**
- 4 launches/month = **$1,200/month**

### 3. Bundle Sales

**Strategy:**
- Create 5-10 related e-books
- Sell individually at $9.99 each
- Offer bundle at $49.99 (save $50)
- Bundle conversion rate typically 2x higher

**Example:**
- 10 individual sales × $9.99 = $99.90

**Strategy:**
- Release new e-book monthly
